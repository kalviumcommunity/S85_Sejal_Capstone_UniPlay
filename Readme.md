## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Since you created the repo manually, here’s how you can set up everything locally:

### 1. Initialize Git and link remote:
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/uniplay.git
```

### 2. Create project structure:
Manually create two folders:
```bash
mkdir client server
```

Then begin developing the React frontend in `client/` and the Express backend in `server/`.

### 3. Install dependencies:

#### Frontend:
```bash
cd client
npm create vite@latest .
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

#### Backend:
```bash
cd ../server
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
```

### 4. Setup environment variables:

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory:

```env
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### 5. Run the app locally:

#### Backend:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend:
```bash
cd ../client
npm run dev
```
